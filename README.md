# Shattered Minds

Shattered minds is a multiplayer co-op game where you have to survive the night.

Normally you will do this by collecting coal (When near - Space on Keyboard/Square on controller)
and loading it into furnaces (When near - Space on Keyboard/Square on controller)

Keeping furnaces fuelled will keep the building warm, indicated by the temperature
gauge on the left. If this gauge reaches the bottom, you die.

However, you may flip to other irrational objects as the stress of the situation and 
bite of the cold get to you:

Eat coal - Collect coal and eat it to give a boost to your temperature. 
Your temperature with otherwise go down while you're not eating.

Hoard coal - Keep the supply to yourself and deprive the furnaces. 
Your temperature will rise as everyone else's falls.

When you have these irrational objectives, alternate interactions are available.
Still bound to the same interaction key (Space on Keyboard/Square on controller),
there will be new, different effects so you may accomplish your goal.


You can check the map with 'm' on keyboard/Press in the right stick for controller, at any time in-game

Good luck and stay warm.
